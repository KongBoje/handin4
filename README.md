# Explain the concept of: Hybrid Mobile App Development

- Native Apps are specific to a given mobile platform (iOS or Android) using the development tools and language that the respective platform supports. Native apps look and perform the best
- HTML5 Apps use standard web technologies, like JavaScript and CSS to create cross platform mobile applications. Limitations from this strategy is, session management, no secure offline storage, no access to native device functionality (camera, calendar etc.)
- Hybrid Apps make it possible to embed HTML5 apps inside a thin native container, combining the best (and worst) elements of Native and HTML5 apps.

# Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development compared to Native App Development

# Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an Ionic Hybrid Application

# Explain and demonstrate ways to debug Hybrid Mobile Applications Running on a real device

# Explain how and why, it is possible for a Hybrid Application to access native phone devices like location, calendar etc. 

# Explain, using an example you have implemented, the "fundamentals" of an Ionic application.

# Explain using an example how your Hybrid Application communicates with a backend 

# Explain, with focus on location, technologies related to locations used on:

## Your app (client side)

## Your backend
